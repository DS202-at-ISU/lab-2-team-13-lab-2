# Lab Report #2: Exploring Residential Sales in Ames

## Description
This lab explores residential sales data in Ames since 2017. Our team analyzed various aspects of the dataset, including key variables influencing sale prices. Findings are summarized below.

## Step 1 Result: Initial Data Inspection
- Identified dataset variables and their types
- Assessed expected data ranges
- Special focus variable selected for further exploration

## Step 2 Result: Exploration of Main Variable (Sale Price)
- Visualized the distribution of sale prices using histograms
- Noted general patterns and any anomalies
- Identified potential outliers

## Step 3 Result: Investigation of a Related Variable
- Selected a variable correlated with Sale Price (e.g., Lot Size, Year Built)
- Visualized the relationship with scatterplots and boxplots
- Analyzed patterns and identified any oddities

## Step 4 Result: Team Member Contributions
- Ash's work: Analyzed the effect of Lot Size on Sale Price, Examined the impact of Year Built on Sale Price and Investigated additional factors (e.g., Neighborhood, House Quality)

## Summary of Findings
- Sale Price is significantly influenced by Lot Size and Year Built
- Certain neighborhoods show higher property values
- Anomalies and outliers identified in older properties and extreme lot sizes

## Conclusion
Our analysis provided insights into key factors affecting residential property sales in Ames. Future work could include deeper statistical modeling to refine predictions.
